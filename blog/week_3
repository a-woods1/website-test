      <h2>What a difference a week makes!</h2>
      <p>Our team always learns so much from research, and this week was no exception. Through recruiting and interviewing users and conducting secondary research, we came to the end of our first summer sprint with a focused need to guide us through the rest of the project.</p>
      <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
      <p>An important activity for us last week was understanding which technologies will be at our disposal for our final summer prototype. Through secondary research, we identified 17 potential technologies that may be of use to us.</p>
      <img class="blog_photo" src="/SSUI-Homework-6/static/assets/images/technology-slide.png" alt="A diagram comparing a simple neural network against a deep learning neural network"/>
      <div class="photo_caption">An example slide from our secondary research</div><br/>
      <p>The questions at the end of each slide were the most important pieces of information for our team to digest. Each of these technologies do not exist in a vacuum--they have unique strengths and weaknesses. After deciding which need to focus on, we will be able to match it to a relevant technology, instead of using a technology just for the sake of using it.</p>
      <h2>User Interviews</h2>
      <p>We had the privilege of interviewing five people with disabilities this week (using our prototypes as prompts to uncover specific needs). It turns out we were wrong about a lot of things! Why are we happy? Because we need to be wrong, a lot, to make sure we build something that works.</p>
      <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
      <p>Technology is not always welcome. Our interviewees gave us a great framework to start thinking about how we should be balancing human-computer interaction when it comes to disclosure.</p>
      <h3>What does technology allow?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keeping consistent records</li>
        <li>Editing self</li>
        <li>Indicating when to stop</li>
        <li>Easier, controlled information sharing</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What does human interaction allow?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reading reactions</li>
        <li>Getting immediate feedback</li>
        <li>Avoiding misconceptions</li>
        <li>Answering questions right away</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our need statement was initially focused around helping people with disabilities think through the benefits and risks of disclosure. However, through our interviews, it became clear that the fear and risk associated with disclosure stems from an inability to control how they disclose and how others will perceive them. The new need that overwhelmingly emerged was ​<b>I need to feel confident about how my disability is represented to stakeholders in the company during the hiring process.</b></p>
      <p>People with disabilities need and deserve to be in control of how others perceive them, which is something that can get lost in a hiring system. We’re excited to build something that will allow people with disabilities to tell their disability narrative in a way that suits them, as well as control who is seeing their disability-related information.</p>
      <p>None of this new information would have been available to us without talking to stakeholders. A highlight for our team this week was attending the A11yNYC Meetup to find others in the New York City Area who are interested in inclusive design and accessibility research. In addition to making some great contacts who will be able to give us feedback in the future, we learned a lot about the inaccessibility of the New York City transit system. Check out <a class="team_links" href="https://www.meetup.com/A11yNYC/events/250786260/">this page</a> for more information about the event, ​<i>Understanding Transportation Challenges for People With Disabilities in NYC</i>, and a link to the livestream.</p><br/>
