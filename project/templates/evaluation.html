                        The need for B READY emerged from three months of research with Bloomberg during our Spring semester. Based on the problems that we identified, creating a web app to help both Bloomberg recruiting coordinators and candidates with disabilities handle accommodation requests was important. Candidates with disabilities were not always sure if they should disclose, and recruiters an recruiting coordinators did not always know how to best handle accommodation requests. 
                         <br/><br/>


						However, how could we ensure that whatever we built would successfully address these problems? Our team used further research to both create a framework for measurement and test whether or not we were achieving the right results. <br/> <br/>

                        Candidates don't always know if they need to disclose their disability. In order to understand how we could address this, we conducted several co-design sessions with people with disabilities. In one of these sessions, a participant shared a mental model that has served us well for evaluating our prototype. They focus on the following steps when trying to understand if they should request an accommodation:

                        We continued iterating on our designs until the prototype outperformed the email significantly. Some of the changes we made along the way include:<br/><br/>

                        <ul>
                        	<li> Creating accessibility call outs in our content to help users evaluate the need for an accommodation 
                        	</li>
                        	<li> Including an immersive, visual view of key spaces to give candidates more detailed information about a space so they can assess if it will be accessible to them.  
                        	</li>
                        	<li> Create an accommodations menu experience that gives candiates more confidence that Bloomberg has accessibility expertise.  
                        	</li>
                        </ul>





                        Our current tool for candidates with disabilities gives them a clearer understanding of what is expected in the interview, lets them evaluate what accommodations they might need and gives space for them to confidently ask for an accommodation.

                        Similarly, we held several codesign sessions with recruiting coordinators to understand their current processes for handling accommodation requests. What were their pain points? What did they care most about in the experience? Two key points emerged:

                        So we decided to focus on two key metrics for recruiters that we measured over ten usability studies:<br/><br/>

                        <ul>
                        	<li> Efficiency: how easy was it to implement an accommodation using this tool?

                        	<li> Confidence: how confident are you that you've done everything you need to make the candidate's interview go smoothly?
                        	</li>
                        </ul>

						Several design iterations helped us achieve an optimal level of efficiency while also giving recruiting coordinators peace of mind:<br/><br/>

                        <ul>
                        	<li> Minimizing the number of steps involved with handling an accommodation request
                        	</li>
                        	<li> Integrating with existing recruiting coordinator systems and tools 
                        	</li>
                        	<li> Providing self-service resources with more information about accommodations
